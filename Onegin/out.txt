and records of a heart in pain.
begs your indulgence -- it's been spun
But, as it is, this pied collection
could have been turned to worthier ends --
from threads both sad and humoristic,
Heedless of the proud world's enjoyment,
in limpid verse that lives and gleams.

of powers unripe, or on the wane,
of reason's icy intimations,
of sleeplessness, faint inspirations,
products of carefree hours, of fun,
themes popular or idealistic,
To Peter Alexandrovich Pletnev
worthier of you in the perfection
your soul displays, in holy dreams,
